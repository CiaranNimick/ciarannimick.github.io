                  As a member of the VEX Robotics teams at Peninsula High School, I was responsible for designing and building competitive robots for multiple challenges. 
                  This involved using Onshape to create detailed models of the robots, in which I designed 12 complete robots over my time on the team. 
                  I also collaborated with team members to brainstorm and refine design ideas, and participated in testing and troubleshooting to identify and resolve issues.
                  Through this experience, I developed strong skills in mechanical design, problem-solving, and teamwork, which have been valuable in my academic and professional pursuits.

                  As the longest serving president of the VEX robotics teams at Peninsula High School, I increased yearly funding by 400% through sponsorships, grant writing, and organizing fundraisers.
                  Additionally, I led the teams to multiple state championships and the first state award in 6 years. I also mentored younger students, helping them develop their skills and confidence in robotics and 
                  oragnized the inagural Peninsula High School VEX competition, which has now become an annual event.

                  As part of the VEX Robotics competition, I was partially responsible for documenting our design process, including CAD models, engineering notebooks, and competition debriefs. 
                  Justifying design decisions and reflecting on our successes and failures helped us improve our designs and strategies over time, aiding my team in winning multiple local events and awards.
